Just the basics of git. In this README it'll outline the basics of pushing your lab to github.

Terminal Method (Windows command prompt, MacOS/Linux terminal, etc):

1. Install git - Here's a link that outlines how to install git across multiple operating systems: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
2. Create a folder. Then in your terminal, change directory to that folder
3. Make sure you're in that folder. Then initialize the folder as a git repository via ```git init```
4. Copy the https link to the repository. You can find it on the main page of your repository. Look for the  ```diff green button ```
