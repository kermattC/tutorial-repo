Just the basics of git. In this README it'll outline the basics of pushing your lab to github.

Terminal Method (Windows command prompt, MacOS/Linux terminal, etc):

1. Install git - Here's a link that outlines how to install git across multiple operating systems: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
2. Create a folder. Then in your terminal, change directory to that folder
3. Make sure you're in that folder. Then initialize the folder as a git repository via ```git init```
4. Copy the https link to the repository. You can find it on the main page of your repository. Click on the green button on the right that says "Code" and copy the link. It should end with ".git"
5. Clone or pull the repo. _Either way works for the case of the lab, but I highly encourage you to look up the difference between the two since you'll probably be using git for your group projects._ To clone the repo, use ```git clone <your-repo-link-here>```. For example in this repo, I would type this in the command line: ``` git clone https://github.com/kermattC/tutorial-repo.git ```. And for pull: ```git pull https://github.com/kermattC/tutorial-repo.git```
